                        Tesla was born "at the stroke of midnight" with lightning striking during a summer storm. He was born to a Serbian family
                        in Smiljan near Gospić, Lika, (the Military Frontier of Austria-Hungary, now in Croatia). The midwife
                        commented, "He'll be a child of the storm," to which his mother replied, "No, of light."
